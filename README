showrss.pl
An automated torrent downloader

ShowRSS (http://showrss.karmorra.info) creates RSS feeds for torrents of your favourite TV shows. It also allows you to create a personal feed for the shows you like.
showrss.pl is a Perl script to automatically download new torrents that appear in your personal feed. It is designed to be run on a server running something like the Transmission daemon, configured with a watchdir.

Usage
=====

1) Run 'showrss.pl -c' to create a config file. Follow the on-screen prompts.
2) Run showrss.pl and leave running.

If you want to see where the log file is, run:

showrss.pl -l

The log file is appended at each interval with the number of torrents processed, whether they were downloaded, skipped or failed.

Requires
========
A recent install of Perl (tested with Perl 5.8.8) and the following modules:

XML::Simple
LWP::Simple
URI::Escape
Date::Parse
YAML
